We are living through a golden age of financial innovations and banking technologies, the so-called FinTech revolution. This flurry of activity and investment has helped to increase attention on the long-standing global issues of financial literacy and access to banking and credit systems. As today’s new systems grow in complexity, and as economic opportunity increases for those who have access, we must take action to include the “Bottom of the Pyramid” in this ‘digital dawn’. Across emerging markets, this is especially pressing for women and enterprising youth who run small ventures without the benefit of secondary school education, and less in many cases.

Below is our diagnosis of the issue and a proposed shift in approach, which we will begin testing for soon. This is a massive economic and social topic, so naturally there’s many points we’re bound to miss out the gate. We hope that our proposals are broad but exact enough to enable rich conversations, as well as the identification of other needed, high-potential products.
